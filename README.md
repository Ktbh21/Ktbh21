- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ktbh21 . You can call me Kevin!
- 👀 I’m currently working as a QA enginner and i am looking to progress on to a software developer one day!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code. I am sharing some items i have learnt via bootcamp and videos and hope they can remind me to keep going.
- 💞️ I used a templete provided by git! Thought it was really cool and simple so i decided to stick with it!
